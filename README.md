# Secure PenBox

Secure PenBox:
A sandboxed penetration testing environment that lets the user upload an image of their web application and conducts standard vulnerability assessments using a predefined set of enumeration tools and presents the results in a report.
Used the Aws Ec2 cloud service to produce a sandboxed Kali Linux environment, synced it with the S3 storage service to import a docker image of a test web application to the ec2 instance, used a bash script for enumeration and vulnerability assessment and exported the reports back to the user via an endpoint.   
This project allows developers to test and assess their web applications for different bugs, vulnerabilities and loopholes before pushing their secure and bug free product to the internet.


## Solution Pipeline


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Have Kali Linux Pre-Installed 

Have Docker Pre-Installed 

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
